# What is TetanOS?

TetanOS is a reasearch operating system written in Rust. It is a microkernel-based operating system that is designed to be simple, modular, and extensible. The goal of TetanOS is to provide a clean and minimalistic operating system that is easy to understand and hack on, while still being powerful and efficient for low-power embedded devices.

TetanOS is still a work in progress, and there is a lot of work to be done. If you are interested in operating systems, systems programming, or Rust, you are welcome to contribute to TetanOS. You can find the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/HaldiH/TetanOS).

## Rust

Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety. It is a low-level language that is designed to be memory safe and fast without sacrificing high-level language features. Rust is a great choice for developing operating systems.

## Microkernel

A microkernel is a minimalistic kernel that provides only the essential services to run an operating system. It is designed to be small, efficient, and secure. A microkernel-based operating system is more modular, flexible, and easier to maintain than a monolithic kernel.
