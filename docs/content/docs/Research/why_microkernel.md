# Why using the Microkernel Architecture?

The [microkernel architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microkernel) is a software architecture that is based on the idea of dividing the operating system into small, modular components that communicate with each other using well-defined interfaces. This architecture has several advantages over traditional monolithic operating systems, including:

1. **Modularity**: The microkernel architecture allows the operating system to be divided into small, independent modules that can be developed, tested, and maintained separately. This makes it easier to add new features, fix bugs, and optimize performance.
2. **Flexibility**: Because the microkernel architecture is modular, it is easier to customize the operating system to meet the specific needs of different users and applications. For example, a user could choose to include only the modules they need, rather than installing the entire operating system.
3. **Reliability**: The microkernel architecture is designed to be more reliable than traditional monolithic operating systems. Because the components of the operating system are isolated from each other, a failure in one component is less likely to affect other components. This makes it easier to diagnose and fix problems, and reduces the risk of system crashes.
4. **Security**: The microkernel architecture is more secure than traditional monolithic operating systems because it limits the amount of code that runs in kernel mode. This reduces the attack surface of the operating system, making it harder for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities.
5. **Scalability**: The microkernel architecture is more scalable than traditional monolithic operating systems because it allows the operating system to be distributed across multiple processors or machines. This makes it easier to take advantage of modern hardware, such as multi-core processors and cloud computing resources.

## How does the Microkernel Architecture work?

The microkernel architecture is based on the idea of dividing the operating system into two main components: the microkernel and the user-space servers. The microkernel is a small, minimalistic component that provides basic operating system services, such as process management, memory management, and [inter-process communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-process_communication) (IPC). The user-space servers are larger, more complex components that provide higher-level operating system services, such as file systems, device drivers, and network protocols.

The microkernel and user-space servers communicate with each other using well-defined interfaces, such as [remote procedure calls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call) (RPC) or [message passing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_passing). This allows the components of the operating system to be developed, tested, and maintained independently, and makes it easier to add new features, fix bugs, and optimize performance.

## Examples of Microkernel-based Operating Systems

There are several examples of microkernel-based operating systems, including:

- [**GNU Hurd**](https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/): A collection of servers that run on top of the [*Mach*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mach_(kernel)) microkernel.
- [**Minix**](https://www.minix3.org/)(*discontinued*): A microkernel-based operating system that is designed for teaching purposes. It was written by [Andrew S. Tanenbaum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_S._Tanenbaum) as an alternative to the monolithic [*Linux*](https://www.linux.org/) kernel (see [Tanenbaum-Torvalds debate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanenbaum%E2%80%93Torvalds_debate)).
- [**QNX**](https://www.qnx.com/): A real-time operating system that is used in embedded systems and other safety-critical applications.

## Why develop a new Microkernel-based Operating System?

There are several reasons why we would want to develop a new microkernel-based operating system:

- **Research**: Building a new microkernel architecture provides an opportunity to explore fresh concepts and techniques in OS design. This fosters a deeper understanding of various approaches, enabling us to identify their strengths and limitations while crafting innovative solutions to existing challenges.
- **Education**: Creating such an operating system offers a valuable hands-on experience for students and researchers, helping them deepen their grasp of system concepts and develop practical skills in system programming and software engineering.
- **Innovation**: The microkernel approach enables innovation in areas like security, reliability, and scalability. Leveraging recent research and cutting-edge technology, we can design a system that outperforms current alternatives in terms of these critical features.
