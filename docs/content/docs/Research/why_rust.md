# Why using the Rust programming language?

Rust is a good fit when it comes to kernel development. It is a systems programming language that is focused on safety, speed, and concurrency. Rust is designed to be memory safe and thread safe, and it does not have a garbage collector. Rust is a good fit for kernel development because it is a low-level language that provides fine-grained control over memory layout and allocation. Rust also has a strong type system that helps prevent bugs and makes it easier to reason about code.

Rust is also a good fit for kernel development because it has a strong focus on performance. Rust is designed to be fast and efficient, and it has a number of features that make it well-suited for systems programming. Rust has zero-cost abstractions, which means that high-level code can be compiled down to low-level code without any performance penalty. Rust also has a powerful macro system that allows for code generation and metaprogramming, which can be useful for kernel development.

## Why not using C?

C has been the traditional language of choice for kernel development, and it is still widely used today. C is a low-level language that provides fine-grained control over memory layout and allocation, and it is well-suited for systems programming. C is also a mature language with a large ecosystem of libraries and tools that are useful for kernel development. However, C comes from the early days of Unix and has some design flaws that can make it difficult to write safe and secure code. C is prone to buffer overflows, null pointer dereferences, and other common security vulnerabilities. C also lacks modern language features like strong typing and memory safety, which can make it difficult to reason about code and prevent bugs.
